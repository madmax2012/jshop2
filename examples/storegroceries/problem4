;; The initial state in the problem definition contains the characteristics of ;;the objects used for classifying them (e.g. a1 is bag). This should be added ;;by the perception mechanism to the knowledge base instead of being in the ;;initial state.

;; All shelves hold objects of just one type. Initially all shelves hold one object.
;; We assume that there is only one cupboard which holds all the shelves
